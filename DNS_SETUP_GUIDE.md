# VIP Edge Racing - Domain DNS Setup Guide

## Step 1: Identify Your Domain Registrar

Your domain `vipsimracing.com` was purchased from a domain registrar. Here's how to find out which one:

### Method 1: WHOIS Lookup
1. Go to [whois.net](https://whois.net) or [whois.com](https://whois.com)
2. Enter `vipsimracing.com`
3. Look for "Registrar" in the results

### Method 2: Check Your Email
- Search your email for "vipsimracing.com" 
- Look for purchase confirmations or renewal notices
- Common registrars include: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare, Network Solutions

### Method 3: Try Logging In
Try logging into these common registrar websites with your email:
- [GoDaddy.com](https://godaddy.com) - Most popular
- [Namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) - Popular alternative
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) - Google's service
- [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) - Popular for DNS management

## Step 2: Access Your Domain's DNS Settings

Once you've identified your registrar:

### For GoDaddy:
1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" â†’ "Domains"
3. Find `vipsimracing.com` and click "DNS"
4. Look for "DNS Management" or "Manage DNS"

### For Namecheap:
1. Log into your Namecheap account
2. Go to "Domain List"
3. Click "Manage" next to `vipsimracing.com`
4. Go to "Advanced DNS" tab

### For Google Domains:
1. Log into Google Domains
2. Find your domain and click "Manage"
3. Go to "DNS" in the left sidebar

### For Cloudflare:
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Select your domain
3. Go to "DNS" tab

## Step 3: Update DNS Records

You need to replace the current DNS records (pointing to Squarespace) with new ones pointing to Netlify.

### Current Netlify App URL
Your app is currently deployed at: `https://your-netlify-subdomain.netlify.app`

### DNS Records to Add:

#### Option A: Point to Netlify's Load Balancer (Recommended)
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-netlify-subdomain.netlify.app
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
```

#### Option B: Use Netlify's Custom Domain Feature
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Find your deployed site
3. Go to "Domain settings"
4. Click "Add custom domain"
5. Enter `vipsimracing.com`
6. Netlify will provide specific DNS instructions

### Records to Remove:
- Delete any existing A records pointing to Squarespace
- Delete any CNAME records pointing to Squarespace domains
- Keep MX records (for email) if you have email set up

## Step 4: Verify the Changes

### Immediate Testing:
- Changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- You can test immediately using: [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net)
- Enter `vipsimracing.com` to see DNS propagation status

### Expected Results:
- `vipsimracing.com` should show your racing simulator app
- `www.vipsimracing.com` should also work
- No more Squarespace parking page

## Step 5: SSL Certificate

Netlify will automatically provision an SSL certificate for your custom domain once DNS is properly configured.

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Site not supported" error:
- This means DNS is still pointing to Squarespace
- Double-check that you've updated the A record to `75.2.60.5`
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### If you can't find your registrar:
- Check your credit card/bank statements for domain charges
- Look for emails from domain companies
- Contact me with any domain purchase receipts you can find

### If you need immediate access:
- Use the direct Netlify URL while DNS updates
- Share the Netlify URL with customers temporarily

5. Update social media links to point to the new site
